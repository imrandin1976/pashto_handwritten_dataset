Dataset of Pashto language Handwritten characters
I have converted different formats in idx format, just like mnist handwritten datasets are formated in training and testing files. The ratios are as follows for experimentation purposes
1. convert_MNIST_40 is 40:60  training:testing data
2. convert_MNIST_50 is 50:50  training:testing data
3. convert_MNIST_60 is 60:40  training:testing data
4. convert_MNIST_70 is 70:30  training:testing data
5. convert_MNIST_80 is 80:20  training:testing data
6. convert_MNIST_90 is 90:10  training:testing data
7. pashto_characters_28x28 partX.rar (part1 to 11) Contains original images, around 43,000 files, 1000 images for each class totalling of 43 classes. Unzip them all into a single folder and you will get 43000 images in folders 01 to 43 each having 1000 files.
